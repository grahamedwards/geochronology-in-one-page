### Origin Story

As a geochronologist, I always find myself momentarily flummoxed when asked how you get from something that looks like $N=N_oe^{-\lambda t}$ to something that looks like $n = n_o + N \left( e^{\lambda t} - 1 \right)$. Why is the $\lambda$ positive now? Why do we subtract 1? My answer is always, "Hold on, let me do all of this math from scratch *again* to try to make sense of it.

There are some textbooks out there that do a pretty good job, but the math is often scattered across pages with additional information that is useful, but extraneous to my immediate needs. And this is just for a generic equation. What about derivations specific to certain decay systems?

Hence, a most ambitious and reckless project to collapse context, derivation, and application of radiometric decay equations into single page primers.

Hope this helps you as much as it has helped us,
