# ⚛️ Geochronology in one page ⚛️

A one-page LaTeX-generated document summarizing the derivation and application of the radiometric age equation.

As a geochronologist, I always find myself and others momentarily flummoxed when asked how you get from something that looks like $N=N_oe^{-\lambda t}$ to something that looks like $n = n_o + N \left( e^{\lambda t} - 1 \right)$. Why is the $\lambda$ positive now? Why do we subtract 1? My answer is always, "Hold on, let me do all of this math from scratch *again* to try to make sense of it.

There are some textbooks out there that do a pretty good job, but the math is often scattered across pages with additional information that is useful, but extraneous to my immediate needs.

Hence, my most ambitious and reckless project yet: going from derivation to application of the radiometric age equation, in a single page. 

Hope this helps you as much as it has helped me,

Graham
